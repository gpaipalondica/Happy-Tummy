The yeast should begin to foam or bloom, indicating that the yeast is still active and alive.\n\n\n(Note that if you are using \"instant yeast\" instead of \"active yeast\", no proofing is required. Just add to the flour in the next step.)\n\n"

Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.\n\n\nKnead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.\n\n\nIf you don't have a mixer, you can mix the ingredients together and knead them by hand.\n\n\nThe dough should be a little sticky, or tacky to the touch. If it's too wet, sprinkle in a little more flour.\n\n"

Place the pizza dough in the bowl and turn it around so that it gets coated with the oil.\n\n\nAt this point you can choose how long you want the dough to ferment and rise. A slow fermentation (24 hours in the fridge) will result in more complex flavors in the dough. A quick fermentation (1 1/2 hours in a warm place) will allow the dough to rise sufficiently to work with.\n\n\nCover the dough with plastic wrap.\n\n\nFor a quick rise, place the dough in a warm place (75째F to 85째F) for 1 1/2 hours.\n\n\nFor a medium rise, place the dough in a regular room temperature place (your kitchen counter will do fine) for 8 hours. For a longer rise, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 24 hours (no more than 48 hours).\n\n\nThe longer the rise (to a point) the better the flavor the crust will have.\n\n"
